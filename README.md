Makes use of the following softwares:

**Gradle** - I do not recall downloading, just install the VSCode extension

**Java 21** - Set JAVA_HOME in User Variables of Environment Variables to the jdk-21 folder path. https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21

**Kotlin Command Line Compiler Version 2.1.0** - Download the zip and extract it to a folder. Then set the path as listed: set "Path" to the bin folder of the compiler folder in environment variables for User Variables (possibly also for System Varaibles just to be safe if it is not being recognized in command prompt) https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.0


**Code is ran from command line. Ensure that you are in the Color-Sensor directory or gradle will not be recognized**

For building and cleaning, use:

"gradlew clean" and "gradlew build" or " gradlew clean build"

To run the code, use "gradlew run"
